Object Pool Design Pattern

Object pools ( aka resource pools ) are used to manage the object caching. This can offer
a significant performance boost. It is most effective in situations where the cost of 
init of a object instance is high, the rate of init of object is high and the no of 
instance in use at any one time is low.

Components:
Client: Used an object from pool.
ReusablePool: The pool of objects.
Object Pool: Maintains a list of available objects and collections of objects that have already
             been requested.

The client with access to a object pool avoid creating a new object by simply asking the pool
for one that has already been instantiated. Generally the pool will be growing pool, i.e. the
pool itself will create new objects if the pool is empty, or we can have a pool, which restricts
the number of objects created.

Example:
- Database connections.
- Server listening to request keeps a pool of threads.
